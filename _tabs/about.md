In my work life I manage a team of software engineers.  In my personal life I'm a father who enjoys writing, playing music, and video games.  

I have had the idea for this blog kicking around for years, and finally felt the drive to do something about it.  I want to share my thoughts on work and my hobbies so that maybe they can provide value to others.  Regardless I'm sure it will be a good time.  

If you are interested in my work history check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomduran), I'd love to connect.
